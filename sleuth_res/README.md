## Short description of results received with help of sleuth package

* box_1, box_2, box_3, box_4 - boxplots of 4 random significant TEs across all stages&replicants drawn with considering bootstrap values
* cor_matrix - correlation between all samples (Spearman method)
* cor_plot - correlation plot
* heatmap - heatmap for 20 most significant TEs (each color represents the value of log(TPM))
* pc_variance_plot_1 - % of variance explained by each PC
* pca_est_counts - PCA 
* penelope_bootstrap - matrix served as an example of bootstrap values which are used in boxplots
* plot_loadings_PC1, plot_loadings_PC2 - describes which 7 TEs are the most significant in PC1 and PC2
* plot_loadings_PC1 - describes which 50 TEs are the most significant in PC1
* res_matrix - matrix with TPM values of each TE
* sleuth_significant - matrix with TEs ordered by their significance
