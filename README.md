# Identifying differentially expressed transposons across four life-cycle stages of Fasciola hepatica

## Introduction
Transposable elements (TEs) are highly repetitive mobile sequences, which play diverse roles in genome regulation. As well, it is expected that TEs participate in lncRNAs function. In trematodes, lncRNA might be involved in development processes and life cycle regulation. For future studies it is significant to explore connection between TEs expression and developmental stages.

## Mission
Our study is devoted to detecting transposons in transcriptomes of four different life-cycle stages of F. hepatica and analyzing their differential expression across stages.

## Goals
1. Create mapping of RNA-seq data onto a list of transposons sequences 
2. Quantify expression from mappings for each transposon
2. Normalize TE data using statistical approach
4. Discover differentially expressed TEs on each stage of F. hepatica life cycle
